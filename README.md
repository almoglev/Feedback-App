# Rank-It - React Feedback App

This is a hands-on project I developed while self-learning the course [React Front To Back 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) by Brad Traversy on Udemy. It allows users to add, update and delete feedbacks. It uses a mock REST api with json-server.

In this project I learned all of the fundamentals of React including:

- Components
- JSX
- Props (proptypes, defaultprops, etc)
- State (Component & App Level)
- Styling
- Handling Events
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Context API
- HTTP Requests

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
